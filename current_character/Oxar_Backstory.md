# Øxar's Backstory

## Origins: The Ashen Shore

Øxar was born in a small fishing hamlet on the **Ashen Shore of Alsvartr**, a bleak stretch of coast battered by icy seas. Life there was hard, with little more than fish, seals, and the stubbornness of its people to keep them alive.

From his earliest years, Øxar's mouth was quicker than his hands. He spoke up when he should have stayed silent, mocked when he should have bowed, and was forever loud where others held their tongues.

## The Taking: A Thrall's Beginning

That sharp tongue drew the wrong attention. When Øxar was still a boy, a travelling chieftain, **Jarl Styrkar One-Eye**, passed through his hamlet. The jarl, angered by the boy's cheek, declared him a thrall and carried him off.

Øxar was bound and taken inland to **Enkleistra**, one of Alsvartr's largest and harshest settlements.

## The Pits: Forged in Blood

There, Øxar grew into a fighter. At first, he was thrown into the pits to amuse Styrkar's guests, bloodied in matches against other thralls. As his body hardened and his shoulders broadened, he was set against young warriors of rival clans, fighting as a brutal champion to bring honor and fear to his master's hall.

Yet even in the blood and mud, his wit never failed him. He jeered his enemies, called out their flaws, and barked observations about tactics that others missed.

At first, Styrkar mocked him for his loud mouth, but over time, the jarl came to see its worth. Øxar's sharp tongue proved as valuable as his greataxe arm. He began advising in small matters of raids and battles, then greater ones. The loud-mouthed thrall had become a trusted voice.

## The Battle of Enkleistra: Earning Freedom

His moment of greatest triumph came when raiders from the **Green Lights of the East** swept into Alsvartr, nearly overrunning Enkleistra. Øxar rallied fighters, set ambushes, and turned the tide of battle. The chieftain's hall was saved, and the village stood because of his cunning as much as his axe.

In gratitude, **Jarl Styrkar did what few in Alsvartr would dare**: he granted Øxar his freedom.

With that freedom came his greataxe and the chain mail he had fought in—not as tools of bondage, but as tokens of respect.

## The Wandering: A Free Man

Now Øxar wanders, drifting west into **Nionaem**, where mercenaries, raiders, and adventurers find work and fame.

He is drawn to those who dare speak their mind—the brave, the foolish, the outspoken—for he knows the price of words can be chains, but also freedom.

---

## Faith: The Storm's Fury

Øxar gives his strength and his oaths to **Thor**, god of thunder and protection. He calls upon Thor in the clash of arms, believing that each swing of his greataxe carries the storm's fury.

To Øxar, speaking truth loudly and fighting with valor are both acts of worship.

## Who He Is Now

Wherever he goes, he is both warrior and advisor, quick with his axe and quicker with his tongue.

- To some, he is a **brawler**.
- To others, a **strategist**.
- To all, he is **Øxar**: once a thrall, now a free man who makes his own fate upon the battlefields of Svilland.
